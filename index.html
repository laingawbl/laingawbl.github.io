			<h2>the status of things at this very moment [<span class="figure">March 3, 2016</span>]</h2>
			<p>I have been at school for a couple months. It's pretty good. Summer's gonna suck because I'll be taking 6 classes.</p>
			<p>I had a slow think (although it was intermittent, over like 3 or 4 weeks) about what <i>employability</i> means and what an <i>employable person</i> does. I think I would rather be employed than employable.  </p>
			<p>I competed at Battlesnake 2016 in a team with Brendon Earl. I only did it for the free shirt, but then they said they were out of free shirts. My expectations were pretty low because I know nothing about heroku, but we surpassed them greatly, because our snake got to the Classic tier finals. But then we died right away. His name was <i>brendon but a snake</i> because Brendon didn't like my first suggestions, which were <i>splunt</i>, <i>flanch</i>, and <i>jchurnch</i>, in that order. Rest in peace. </p>
 			<p> I haven't been able to stick to a side project. Part of that is that I'm in school now and school is so interesting and also I have to do it or I'll be sent back to laos. Here are some of the things I thought about doing:
 			<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></span> A web app that would help you structure and plan out your courses at UVic, term by term. The phrase "critical path dependency" floated around my mind. After about a week of prodding at this problem it came to my attention that a bunch of my friends had the same idea independently. So we all joined forces. Then we didn't do anything. The most interesting thing I got was a CSV full of UVic courses and descriptors (there are about 5000 of them), scraped off the UVic calendar site, which I can prod about with python/pandas. I would like to point out for the record that I got all the scraping done <i>before</i> I joined the other team.
 			<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></span> Some kind of program that would grab Quandl information and look for correlations, because, you know, financial industry = $$$$ = get to eat at tacofino three times a day. Prodding around at this taught me that a lot of things are pretty correlated (R-squared over 0.96) even if there's no obvious causation. Also, I read Alan Greenspan's <i>The Map and the Territory 2.0</i> which I realised is full of exactly that kind of analysis, and also he's been doing it for decades. But I got some pretty neat shots out of it.</p>

 			<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></span> a better version of tectonics.js and I am not sure if this one is done or not because I find it mildly interesting </p>

			<h2> what's with the <span class="figure">yellow figures</span>? </h2>
			<p> One of my favourite games is Paradox Interactive's Crusader Kings II. (Yes, history nerd.) I have always liked how it displayed useful figures - names, dates, amounts of gold - with colours, rather than styles of bolding and italicizing. </p>
			<a href="src/ck2ui.png"><img src="src/ck2ui.png" alt="his name is murchad, he loves to patricirchad" style="width:307px;"></img></a>
			<p> It looks pretty neat.</p>
