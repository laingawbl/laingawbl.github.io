			<h1> Hi! I'm Alex.</h1>
			<p class="lead">I'm going back to school on 2016-01-04. Until then, I'm going to learn how to make my site look nicer. <br> How? </p>

		<h2>TransferQuest 2015!</h2>
		
		<p class="chunk">I switched from Mechanical Engineering to Software Engineering on September 27th. It's one of the better choices I've made. Thinking back to the end of first year, I only went into MECH because it was the hardest discipline to get into. A respectable reasoning for some, maybe, but the wrong one for me. "What I enjoy doing" or "What I did for fun in high school" didn't factor into my decision. I regret that it took me the better part of a year to realise my error. </p>
		<p class="chunk">That said, it's probably only regret. Period! I've spent the past month rediscovering all the things I love doing. I've gone from fretting over free-body diagrams and methods of tempering steel, to... well, fretting over Pandas dataframes and how to make this site work, but <i>enjoying it</i>. </p>
		<p class="chunk">My <a class="inline" href="https://github.com/laingawbl/">Github account</a> is two weeks old. [<b>TODO:</b> replace "two weeks" with something automatically updated.] I'm liking Github's contributions chart - the green squares - because of how accountable it makes me. As the acquaintance who pointed the feature out to me mentioned, you can put "love to code in my free time" on your resume, but if your Github activity's a big blank grid - or worse, a big blank grid with 20 or 30 commits the day before your big interview - people will see right through your sham. </p>
 		<p class="chunk"> I want to work with that kind of accountability when I build this site. Usually, you want your resume page to be polished and neat - to show off your stronger suits to potential employers. But I just transferred into this thing. I know next to nothing about software engineering. I don't really have a strong suit - knowledge-wise - to show off. </p>
 		<p class="chunk"> So instead, I want this site to showcase what I <i>do</i> have: an honest impulse to learn and improve myself constantly, at all times. That's why I'm going to put aside time each week to work on this site, and push a commit, let's say, every Monday. It might look like something different every time. It might be horribly broken. </p>
 		<p class="chunk">But it'll look darn good on my contributions chart. These gits don't lie!</p>
